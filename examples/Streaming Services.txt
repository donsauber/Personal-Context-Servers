Streaming Services

[=Overview=]
This context covers streaming services used on the living room Roku and other devices. It tracks which services exist, which emails they are tied to, and where to manage each account. The goal is to avoid guessing which login belongs to what.

Different services intentionally use different emails. This file exists to avoid password reset loops and account confusion. When adding a new streaming service, create a new Account section here and link it to the Roku if applicable.

This file should render cleanly in ContextViewer, expose accounts to CredentialManager, and still make perfect sense if opened in a plain text editor five years from now.
