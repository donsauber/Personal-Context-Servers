Home Personal Role

[=Role=]
name: Home Personal
description: Personal home context including services, cameras, and notes.
intent: Everyday personal use from a trusted environment.

[Folders]
description: Folders that are mounted when this Role is active.

folder: PersonalContexts/
folder: HomeSystems/
folder: Media/

notes: These folders are selected explicitly by the user when activating the Role.
The Role does not grant access. It only declares intent and scope.

[Applications]
description: Applications available while this Role is active.

app: ContextViewer
app: CredentialManager
app: CameraViewer

notes: Applications interpret context files but do not own data.

[Defaults]
description: Optional starting behavior.

start_app: ContextViewer
remember_last_context: true

[Notes]
This Role is meant for personal, non-work usage. Business and client contexts
should live under a separate Role to avoid accidental overlap. No security
boundaries are enforced here; access is inherited from the filesystem and OS.

Why this Role file is correct

This Role file:

Declares scope, not permission

Names folders without assuming structure

Lists apps without hard-wiring behavior

Contains human-readable intent

Remains meaningful even without tooling

If the extension vanished, this file would still explain how the user thought about their context.
