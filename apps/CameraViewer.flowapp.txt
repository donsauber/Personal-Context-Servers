Why this is the correct CameraViewer

This file does something subtle but very important:

• It interprets Camera sections, it does not own them
• It does not assume recording, AI, or timelines
• It never embeds streams automatically
• It always defers to explicit user action

That keeps it safe, browser-compatible, and vendor-neutral.

If a stream can be opened, it opens.
If it can’t, nothing breaks.
The context remains intact.

How this composes with ContextViewer

ContextViewer answers:
“What is in this file?”

CameraViewer answers:
“What can I do with the cameras in this file?”

They never compete.
They never duplicate data.
They never rewrite content.

That’s exactly how PCS apps should relate.
