Why this file is right

This does a few very important things correctly:

It treats Context Files as pages, not data blobs
It preserves ordering and human intent
It never assumes schemas
It never modifies files
It degrades gracefully to raw text

If Copper parsing fails, the file is still readable.
If a section is unknown, it still renders.
If tooling disappears, nothing is lost.

That’s exactly the durability PCS is aiming for.
